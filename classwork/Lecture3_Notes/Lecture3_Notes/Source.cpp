// INTRODUCTION TO OBJECTS IN PROGRAMMING
/* Definition of Objects:
 * General: In everyday life, an object is a tangible item.
 * Programming: An object is an  of a class in object oriented programming (OOP). Encapsulates both state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
 * 
 * Components of an Object:
 * State (Attributes): Data  in the object (variables)
 * Behavior (Methods):  that an object can perform (functions)
 */

// TRANSITION FROM PROCEDURAL TO OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)
/* Procedural Programming: Data functions are  . Data is passed between functions, oftening leading to
 * Lack of data integrity, Code duplication, and Difficulties in extending/upgrading programs.
 * 
 * Object Oriented Programming: Solves many issues by  data and functions within objects.
 */

// OVERVIEW OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
/* Definition: A programming paradigm centered around  .
 * Key benefits: Modular and reuseable code; and easier maintenance and organization 
 */

// CHARACTERISTICS OF OOP
/* Abstraction: Simplifies complex systems by focusing on  an object does, not how it does it.
 * 
 * Encapsulation: Bundles data and behavior, ensuring data integrity by restricting access. Promotes  hiding.
 * 
 * Inheritance: New classes (derived/child) inherit attributes and methods from existing classes base/parent).
 * Promotes code  and hierarchial structures
 * 
 * Polymorphism: Allows objects of different clases to be treated as instances of  superclass.
 * Enables flexibility with method  (same method name with different implementations). 
 */

// OBJECT RELATIONSHIPS IN OOP
/* Types of Relationships (using UML notation where applicable):
 * Composition: A "part of" relationship (room and house)
 * 
 * Aggregation: A "has a" relationship (course and students)
 * 
 * Dependency: A "uses a" relationship (browser and internet connection).
 * 
 * Association: Stronger mututal dependency (bees and flowers)
 * 
 * Inheritance: An "is a" relationship (square is a type of shape)
